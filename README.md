# LEARN BOOTSTRAP 4: UTILITIES AND COMPONENTS

## Adding a Card

> Bootstrap also has a card component that serves as a container for smaller customized content. Card components are often grouped together to display a collection of similar content in manageable chunks. We can draw a comparison of the card component to playing cards in deck — in both cases, there are cards grouped together and each one contains something different.

> Below is an example modified from [Bootstrap’s card documentation:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/card/#example)

```js
<div class="card">
  <img class="card-img-top" src="placeholder.jpg" alt="card example image">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Card description goes here.</p>
    <a href="#" class="card-link">Link to somewhere.</a>
  </div>
</div>

```

> Let’s highlight a few key points from the example:

- To make a card component we need to assign a class of "card" to an element.
- Inside the card component, there are two children, an <img> and a <div> element.
- The <img> has a class of "card-img-top" which adds styling and formatting to the image.
- The <div> has a class of "card-body" which adds a section with default padding.
- The content inside the card body all have classes with "card-{value}" which adds styling to these elements specific for Bootstrap cards.
- By default, this card will take up the entire width of its parent element.
  > Let’s add some of our own cards, remember to check [Bootstrap’s card documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/card/#example) for more customizations!
